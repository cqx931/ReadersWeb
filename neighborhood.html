<h5>Typographic Neighborhood in <i>The Readers Project</i></h5>

<p>At an early stage in the development of <i>The Readers Project</i> it was realized that we required a formal definition of <span class="smallcaps">neighborhood</span> for a particular word or cell within the text conceived as a grid. (See: Howe &amp; Cayley, '<i>The Readers Project</i>: Procedural Agents and Literary Vectors' <i>Leonardo</i> 44.4 (August 2011) 317-24. <a href="http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/LEON_a_00208" target="_blank"><span class="smallcaps">abstract</span></a>) We also realized at this stage that this definition was essentially <i>typographic</i>, dependent, for example, upon "the prior specification of a typographic arrangement of the word-cells, in particular a font at a particular font size implying a particular length of line within the 2D textual plane (and including any and all other typographic considerations)."
</p>

<p>The following is the current formal specification of typographic neighborhood in <i>The Readers Project</i>.
</p>

<p>Begin with a notional 3x3 grid of nine cells, eight of which are possible <i>neighbors</i>:</p>

<p>
[0] [1] [2]<br>
[3] [4] [5]<br>
[6] [7] [8]<br>
</p>

<p>
[4] = the current word, the live cell, the word being read.<br>
[3] = the preceding word in a conventional European reading order, or if the text is treated as wrap-around, the final word of the text if the current word is its first word.<br>
[5] = the next word in a conventional European reading order, or if the text is treated as wrap-around, the first word of the text if the current word is its last.<br> 
[2] = rightmost word on line above that typographically overlaps on the y-axis (= 'overlapping word')<br>
      or, if current word is on first line, then null,<br>
      but if current is last word in line AND
      boundingBox.x + width &gt;= that of the
      last word on line above
      then = first word of current line.<br>
[1] = overlapping word preceding 2, otherwise null.<br>
[0] = overlapping word preceding 1, otherwise null.<br>
[8] = rightmost overlapping word on line below<br>
      including the first line,<br>
      but if current is last word on line AND
      boundingBox.x + width &gt;= that of the
      last word on line below
      then = first word 2 lines below wrapping
      to first line.<br>
[7] = overlapping word preceding 8, otherwise null.<br>
[6] = overlapping word preceding 7, otherwise null.<br>
</p>

<p><i>The layout of the traditional Moore neighborhood as generally employed in 'the game of life', contrasted with the typographic neighborhood for a textual grid. Note that neither 'eyes' or 'and' are included in the neighborhood due to their lack of vertical overlap (in this example) with the selected word below. The word 'others' is considered to occupy the NE neighbor position while the NW position is null.</i></p>
