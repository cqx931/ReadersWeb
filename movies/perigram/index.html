	<center><p>A Perigram Reader moving through the text of <i>Misspelt Landings</i>
	</p></center>
	<p class="small">This type of reader checks its NE and SE neighbors for potential 3-gram-completing next words. If it finds a completing word then its reading path may diverge, effectively also generating an alternative text. In addition it visually highlights (here, in gray) its leading neighbors, the ones that it is checking for phrase-completions. The word currently being read is in black.
