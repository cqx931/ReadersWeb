	<p class="small">A 'simple reader,' in ochre, spawns infertile (non-spawning) perigram readers, in gray, <i>if</i> words in any and all of its neighboring directions complete perigrammic 3-grams. These spawned readers can only travel in the direction that they were spawned and
	they die if the next word in that direction does <i>not</i> complete a 3-gram.
