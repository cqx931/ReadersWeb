	<p class="small">This type of reader does not use pay attention to its immediate typographic neighborhood. It looks for words that contain letters in a phrase that it is 'spelling out', here: "writing through reading through ..." It does attempt to find phrases that are also perigrammic, but its priority is spelling out its phrase.
